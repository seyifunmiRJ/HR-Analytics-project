# Findings:
1.	The attrition rate of 16.12% is a notable concern, with 237 out of 1470 employees leaving the company. This suggests a significant turnover rate that warrants further investigation.

2.	Analysis of attrition by age group and gender reveals that age group 25-34 are more likely to leave.  
3.	Attrition rates vary across departments, with R&D and sales department taking the major hit with 65.37% and 30.34% respectively. Targeted retention efforts should be channeled to these departments.

4.	Attrition rates also differ based on the educational field of employees. This highlights the importance of understanding how education background influences job satisfaction and retention. Are Life and Medical Sciences graduates really needed in this organization?

5.	The matrix table showing job rating by job role indicates variations in performance across different roles. Aligning performance expectations with job roles can contribute to job satisfaction and potentially reduce attrition.

# Recommendations:
The analysis of attrition data highlights several critical areas for improvement in employee retention strategies. The notable attrition rate of 16.12% warrants further investigation into its underlying causes. Targeted retention efforts should be directed towards the age group of 25-34, which shows a higher likelihood of turnover. Departments with high attrition rates, particularly R&D and sales, require focused retention initiatives. Understanding the impact of educational background on attrition rates, especially for Life and Medical Sciences graduates, is essential. Lastly, aligning performance expectations with job roles can enhance job satisfaction and potentially reduce turnover. Addressing these findings through tailored retention strategies can lead to a more stable and engaged workforce, promoting long-term organizational success.
